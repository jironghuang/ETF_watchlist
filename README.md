# ETF_watchlist

Ok I spent my Friday evening revising the code for parallel-crawling. Essentially tapping on all the cores in my machine.

To use the code, follow these steps.

- Install R and R studio.
- git clone https://github.com/jironghuang/ETF_watchlist
- Open the .Rproj
- Tweak the input file to change your watchlist. Ticker symbol should follow yahoo ticker naming convention (e.g. VWRD.L for the ETF listed on stock exchange)
